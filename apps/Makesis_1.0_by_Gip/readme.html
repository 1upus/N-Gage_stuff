<p><strong><font size="5">Introduction to MakeSis v1.0 by Gip</font></strong></p>
<p>This utility has been written to help you make Symbian Installation Files without 
  become crazy with scripts. It will help crackers to rebuild up a program after 
  cracking it, or to distribute a group of files in one package.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">You can get the last version at <a href="http://www.giptech.tk">http://www.giptech.tk</a></font></strong></p>
<p>Now you can choose between Light and Heavy mode: in Light mode, you can build 
  a SIS file easily with the default options, while in Heavy mode you can use 
  advanced functions. You can switch between Light and Heavy mode simply by clicking 
  on the buttons on the top corners.</p>
<p><strong>Step by Step guide for Light mode:</strong></p>
<p>1) Select the folder which contain all files that will be installed to the 
  device. The Project folder must be structured as it will appear on device memory. 
  For example, if you want to put the file &quot;hello.txt&quot; on &quot;x:\System\Apps\MyApp\&quot;, 
  you must put the file on &quot;x:\...\projectname\System\Apps\MyApp\hello.txt&quot; 
  and specify &quot;x:\...\projectname\&quot; on the &quot;Project path&quot; 
  textbox.</p>
<p>2) Select the destination folder. By default it is the same as origin.</p>
<p>3) Insert the name of the program, that will be displayed during installation</p>
<p>4) Select where do you want to copy each file:<br>
  <img src="bin/mmc.gif" width="16" height="16"> for the MMC<br>
  <img src="bin/ph.gif" width="16" height="16"> for the phone memory<br>
  <img src="bin/usr.gif" width="16" height="16"> user select</p>
<p>5) Click on &quot;Create .sis file&quot;. If no errors happened, sis file will 
  be placed in the folder you specified before. Else, please send me the file 
  log.txt so I can see the cause of the problem.<br>
  <font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>: The sis file can take a 
  long time to build if you have selected big files. Just wait some time also 
  if the program says that the sis is created. Anyway, building a 500Kb file should 
  take not more than 3sec.</p>
<p><strong>Functions available in Heavy mode:</strong></p>
<p>-Select a language for the installation. The default is English. In future, 
  multiple languages support will be added.</p>
<p>- Insert an UID number. You can also take it from the original sis file that 
  you previously disassembled (and cracked) to make it compatible with it.<font color="#FF0000"><strong><br>
  Important info about UID:</strong></font><br>
  The application UID is a unique identifier for the application. Because UIDs 
  are fundamental to Symbian, it is important that they are used correctly when 
  developing programs. To ensure uniqueness, it is essential that UIDs be properly 
  allocated. Uniqueness is guaranteed by managing allocation centrally from a 
  single database. All UIDs must therefore be assigned to users by a central allocating 
  authority. The only exception to this rule a reserved range of values which 
  may be used as UIDs by developers during development but which must not be used 
  in released software.<br>
  During development temporary UIDs may be chosen from the range 0x01000000 to 
  0x0fffffff. Care must still be taken to avoid clashes within development teams 
  and between multiple projects, including old projects, which may be installed 
  on emulator or native platforms. UID clashes may stop a program from loading 
  correctly, typically leading to Not Found errors.</p>
<p>- Selecting &quot;Support all symbians&quot; will make the sis compatible with 
  all Symbian devices. You can also select a specific mobile phone, anyway do 
  it only in extreme situations. To support SE P8xx and P9xx select them. If the 
  sis will be installed on a phone not compatible it will cause the msgbox &quot;Application 
  may not be compatible with phone. Abort?&quot; popup.</p>
<p>- If you want to add a popup message with your own message, just check the 
  box and click on the pen icon to edit it.</p>
<p>- Insert a version. On the first box goes the Major release, on the second 
  the Minor release (2 digit long), on the third the Build.</p>
<p>- You can create a sis file that patches (substitute) some files of an already 
  installed program selecting the &quot;Patch for an existing APP&quot; box. In 
  that case, you MUST specific exactly the same UID of the app to patch and its 
  name.</p>
<p>- You can specify another SIS file that will be installed after yours (without 
  prompting). The second file will be included in the output sis. If you uninstall 
  the first, also the second will be uninstalled.</p>

  If you are english and you can make a better grammatically-correct version of 
  this guide fell free to send it to me.<br>
