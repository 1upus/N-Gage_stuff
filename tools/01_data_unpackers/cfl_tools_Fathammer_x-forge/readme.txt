CFL - COMPRESSED FILE LIBRARY

CFL is a file format that allows several files to be compressed and combined
into one file. X-Forge allows CFL files to be mounted so that applications
see the contents of the CFL files just as if they were expanded and
uncompressed to the actual file system. The benefit is that content can be
tightly compressed and combined into just one file. From the application's
point of view, it will still look as if the files were in the actual file
system, like normal.

The CFL utilities included with X-Forge allows CFL files to be created as
well as uncompressed. To install the utilities, simply copy the makecfl.exe
and uncfl.exe files from the bin directory to some directory on your computer
that is in the operating system executable search path.

See the X-Forge guide for usage and other documentation.
